# Finance Dashboard App

#

this app going to consist of KPIs and information that business persons can use to display their information about key performance indicators,
and other types of data that they need to keep track of their finances for their company.
and this application actually was built with multiple charts and tables.
#
also, I have the predictions page and there we have information about the revenue for the particular company. and actually, I've been using real machine learning, a very basic one, with no open AI for this one, but machine learning using a regression line, which is like a best-fit line that will display the information and show the best-fit line for my particular data.
